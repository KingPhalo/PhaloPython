Operators and their Priorities

Python precisely defines the priorities of all operators, and assumes that operators of a higher priority perform 
their operations before the operators of a lower priority.

Operators and their bindings
The binding of the operator determines the order of computations performed by some operators with equal priority, put side by side in one expression.

Most of Python's operators have left-sided binding, which means that the calculation of the expression is conducted from left to right


The exponentation operatior has a right to left binding
The other operators have a left to right binding.

PRIORITY               OPERATOR

1-                     **     

2-                     +,- unary operators located to the right of the power operator bind stronger

3-                     *, /, //, %  

4-                     +, - (binary)
