What is Python?
Python is a widely-used, interpreted, object-oriented, and high-level programming language with dynamic semantics,
 used for general-purpose programming.


Python 2 vs. Python 3
There are two main kinds of Python, called Python 2 and Python 3.

Python 2 is an older version of the original Python.
 Its development has since been intentionally stalled,
 although that doesn't mean that there are no updates to it.
 On the contrary, the updates are issued on a regular basis, but they are not intended to modify the language in any significant way.
 They rather fix any freshly discovered bugs and security holes.
 Python 2's development path has reached a dead end already, 
but Python 2 itself is still very much alive.

Python 3 is the newer (or to be more precise, the current) version of the language. 
It's going through its own evolutionary path, creating its own standards and habits.
